## What Even is SHE?

You know that feeling when you‚Äôre staying late at work, and suddenly your phone dies, and your boss is giving you creepy vibes? (We see you üëÄ). Yeah, that's when **SHE** comes to your rescue. **SHE** is your personal superhero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, disguised as a discreet web app that **shares your live location**, records audio, and lets you file complaints directly to the **Tamil Nadu Police**. Oh, and don't worry, we‚Äôve made sure it‚Äôs as *sneaky* as your ex during a breakup.

## Tech Stack That Powers Us

Because you know this isn't some lame project from 2015...

- **Next.js**: Because SPAs are *so* last year. Server-side rendering? Yes, please!
- **TypeScript**: Strong types for stronger women üí™.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Faster styling because safety shouldn't have to wait. Plus, who has time for writing CSS from scratch anymore?
- **Gemini API**: Giving us the real-time superpower to track your location.
- **OpenAI API**: Nope, this isn't Skynet (yet), but the AI helps make things *even more* magical.

## Features to Keep You Safe

1. **Live Location Sharing**: Sends your location to your loved ones faster than you can say, "Where's my phone charger?"
2. **Audio Recording**: Get the evidence you need without raising suspicions. Perfect for when things start feeling fishy üêü.
3. **Police Complaint**: File a complaint directly through the **Tamil Nadu Police Portal**. *Yes*, this is legit.
4. **OpenAI-Powered Alerts**: No, we don't have Jarvis. But this AI helps you send alerts intelligently, because why not use AI to keep you safe?
5. **Invisible Mode**: Because no one needs to know you're hitting that SOS button (except the people who need to).

## How it Works (And How We Get You Out of Trouble)

1. **Registration**: Create an account, add your emergency contacts (we recommend family over Tinder dates).
2. **Emergency Mode**: If you feel unsafe, hit that emergency button like you're hitting snooze on a Monday morning.
3. **Live Location Sharing**: Your location gets shared with your contacts *and* authorities, updating in real-time. Take that, creeps.
4. **Audio Recording**: The app will quietly start recording, and store that juicy evidence securely on the cloud. Because, receipts!
5. **Police Complaint**: One tap to submit a complaint. You'll be thanking us later.
6. **AI Assistance**: The app can analyze the situation and help alert the right people (your dad, best friend, and the authorities).

## Installation Guide for Brave Souls

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Your bravery (and coffee, because let‚Äôs be real)

### Steps:

1. Clone this gem of a project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brittytino/SHE.git
   ```
2. Move into the project directory (because why else would you clone it?):
   ```bash
   cd SHE
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies like the responsible developer you are:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up your environment variables for Firebase, Gemini API, OpenAI API, and the Tamil Nadu Police Portal (this is where things get *real*).
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   **Boom**. You‚Äôre ready.

## Usage - How to Save Your Skin

1. **Sign Up**: Input your details (don‚Äôt worry, we keep them safer than your Instagram DMs).
2. **Hit the Button**: When you‚Äôre in a sketchy situation, trigger the emergency mode. It's as simple as ordering pizza online.
3. **Let Us Do the Work**: We‚Äôll handle the live location, audio recording, and alerting the authorities like pros.

## Because We Care About Security

Security is like sunscreen‚Äîcrucial but often ignored until it's too late. So, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done:

- **Data Encryption**: Your location, audio, and personal data are encrypted with AES-256 (yeah, the military-grade stuff).
- **HTTPS**: Because we're fancy like that.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Keeping unauthorized access out of your (digital) purse.

## Roadmap to World Domination

1. **Voice Activation**: Because shouting ‚ÄúHELP!‚Äù should do more than just scare the cat.
2. **State-Wide Expansion**: Tamil Nadu is just the start. World domination is next.
3. **AI-Powered Risk Detection**: We‚Äôre building algorithms that can predict risk before you even realize you‚Äôre in trouble.
